evidence supporting evolutionary theory.
Premises
are important. These are the concepts by
which scientific facts are interpreted.
For over a century,
efforts have been made to explain scientific discoveries
by a mid-19th century theory, known as “evolution.”
It has formed the foundation for many other theo-
ries, which also are not founded on scientific facts!
Restating them again,
here are the two premises on
which the various theories of evolution are based:
1 - This is the evolutionary formula for making a
universe:
Nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural
elements + time = all physical laws and a completely
structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets,
and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order.
2 - This is the evolutionary formula for making life:
Dirt + water + time = living creatures.
Evolutionists theorize that the above two formulas
can enable everything about us to make itself—with
the exception of man-made things,
such as automobiles
or buildings. Complicated things, such as wooden boxes
with nails in them, require thought, intelligence, and care-
ful workmanship. But everything else about us in nature
(such as hummingbirds and the human eye) is declared to
be the result of accidental mishaps, random confusion, and
time. You will not even need raw materials to begin with.
They make themselves too.
How did all this nonsense get started?
We will begin
this paperback with a brief overview of the modern his-
tory of evolutionary theory.
But let us not forget that, though it may be nonsensi-
cal,
evolutionary theory has greatly affected—and dam-
aged—mankind in the 20th century.
Will we continue
to let this happen, now that we are in the 21st century?
The social and moral impact that evolutionary concepts
have had on the modern world has been terrific.
16 The Evolution Cruncher
Morality and ethical standards
have been greatly
reduced. Children and youth are taught in school that they
are
an advanced level of animals
; there are
no moral
principles
. Since they are just animals, they should
do
whatever they want
. Personal survival and success will
come only by
rivalry, strife
, and stepping on others.
Here is a brief overview of some of the people and
events in the history of modern evolutionary theory. But it
is only a glimpse.
Much more will be found as you read
farther in this paperback.
And it is all fascinating read-
ing!
Only a few items are listed in this chapter, but they are
enough to provide you with a nice entry point to the rest of
this paperback. Keep in mind that you can look in the In-
dex, at the back of this paperback, and frequently find still
more information on a given subject (“Linnaeus,” “Ther-
modynamics,” “Guadeloupe Woman,” “Mendel,” etc.).
1 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY SCIENTISTS
Prior to the middle of the 1800s, scientists were re-
searchers
who firmly believed that all nature was made
by a Master Designer.
Those pioneers who laid the foun-
dations of modern science were creationists.
They were
men of giant intellect who struggled against great odds in
carrying on their work. They were hard-working research-
ers.
In contrast, the philosophers sat around, hardly stir-
ring from their armchairs and theorized about everything
while the scientists, ignoring them, kept at their work.
But a change came about in the 19th century, when
the philosophers tried to gain control of scientific en-
deavor
and suppress research and findings that would be
unfavorable to their theories. Today’s evolutionists vigor-
ously defend the unscientific theories they thought up over
a century ago.
William Paley
(1743-1805), in his 1802 classic,
Natu-
ral Theology,
summarized the viewpoint of the scientists.
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 17
He argued that
the kind of carefully designed struc-
tures we see in the living world point clearly to a
Designer.
If we see a watch, we know that it had a de-
signer and maker; it would be foolish to imagine that it
made itself.
This is the “argument by design.”
All about
us is the world of nature, and over our heads at night is a
universe of stars. We can ignore or ridicule what is there
or say it all made itself, but our scoffing does not change
the reality of the situation. A leading atheistic scientist of
our time, *Fred Hoyle, wrote that, although it was not diffi-
cult to disprove Darwinism, what Paley had to say appeared
likely to be unanswerable
(*Fred Hoyle and *Chandra
Wickramasinghe, Evolution from Space, 1981, p. 96).
It is a remarkable fact that the basis of evolution-
ary theory was destroyed by seven scientific research
findings,—before *Charles Darwin first published the
theory.
Carl Linn (Carolus Linnaeus
, 1707-1778) was a sci-
entist who classified immense numbers of living organ-
isms. An earnest creationist, he clearly saw that
there were
no halfway species. All plant and animal species were
definite categories, separate from one another.
Varia-
tion was possible within a species, and there were many
sub-species. But
there were no cross-overs from one spe-
cies to another
(*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution,
1990, p. 276).
First Law of Thermodynamics
(1847). Heinrich von
Helmholtz stated
the
law of conservation of energy
: The
sum total of all matter will always remain the same.
This
law refutes several aspects of evolutionary theory.
*Isaac Asimov calls it “the most fundamental generaliza-
tion about the universe that scientists have ever been able
to make”
(*Isaac Asimov, “In the Game of Energy and
Thermodynamics You Can’t Even Break Even,” Journal
of Smithsonian Institute, June 1970, p. 6).
Second Law of Thermodynamics
(1850). R.J.E.
18 The Evolution Cruncher
Clausius stated
the
law of entropy
:
All systems will tend
toward the most mathematically probable state, and even-
tually become totally random and disorganized
(*Harold
Blum, Time’s Arrow and Evolution, 1968, p. 201).
In other
words,
everything runs down, wears out, and goes to
pieces
(*R.R. Kindsay, “Physics: to What Extent is it De-
terministic,” American Scientist 56, 1968, p. 100).
This
law totally eliminates the basic evolutionary theory that
simple evolves into complex.
*Einstein said the two laws
were the most enduring laws he knew of
(*Jeremy Rifkin,
Entropy: A New World View, 1980, p. 6).
Guadeloupe Woman Found
(1812). This is a well-
authenticated discovery which has been in the British Mu-
seum for over a century. A fully modern human skeleton
was found in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe
inside an immense slab of limestone, dated by modern ge-
ologists at 28 million years old. (More examples could be
cited.)
Human beings, just like those living today (but
sometimes larger), have been found in very deep lev-
els of strata.
Gregor Mendel
(1822-1884) was a creationist who
lived and worked near Brunn (now Brno), Czechoslova-
kia. He was a science and math teacher. Unlike the theo-
rists, Mendel was a true scientist. He bred garden peas and
studied the results of crossing various varieties. Begin-
ning his work in 1856, he concluded it within eight years.
In 1865, he reported his research in the
Journal of the Brunn
Society for the Study of Natural Science
. The journal was
distributed to 120 libraries in Europe, England, and
America. Yet his research was totally ignored by the sci-
entific community until it was rediscovered in 1900
(*R.A.
Fisher, “Has Mendel’s Work Been Rediscovered?” An-
nals of Science, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1936).
His experiments
clearly showed that one species could not transmute
into another one. A genetic barrier existed that could
not be bridged. Mendel’s work laid the basis for mod-
ern genetics, and his discoveries effectively destroyed
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 19
the basis for species evolution
(*Michael Pitman,
Adam and Evolution, 1984, pp. 63-64)
.
Louis Pasteur
(1822-1895) was another genuine sci-
entist. In the process of studying fermentation, he per-
formed his famous 1861 experiment, in which
he dis-
proved the theory of spontaneous generation. Life can-
not arise from non-living materials.
This experiment was
very important; for, up to that time, a majority of scien-
tists believed in spontaneous generation. (They thought
that if a pile of old clothes were left in a corner, it would
breed mice! The proof was that, upon later returning to the
clothes, mice would frequently be found there.)
Pasteur
concluded from his experiment that only God could
create living creatures. But modern evolutionary theory
continues to be based on that out-dated theory dis-
proved by Pasteur: spontaneous generation (life
arises from non-life). Why? Because it is the only
basis on which evolution could occur.
As *Adams notes,
“With spontaneous generation discredited [by Pasteur], bi-
ologists were left with no theory of the origin of life at all”
(*J. Edison Adams, Plants: An Introduction to Modern
Biology, 1967, p. 585).
August Friedrich Leopold Weismann
(1834-1914)
was a German biologist who
disproved *Lamarck’s no-
tion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics.”
He is primarily remembered as the scientist who cut off
the tails of 901 young white mice in 19 successive genera-
tions, yet each new generation was born with a full-length
tail. The final generation, he reported, had tails as long as
those originally measured on the first. Weismann also car-
ried out other experiments that buttressed his refutation of
Lamarckism. His discoveries, along with the fact that cir-
cumcision of Jewish males for 4,000 years had not affected
the foreskin, doomed the theory
(*Jean Rostand, Orion
Book of Evolution, 1960, p. 64).
Yet Lamarckism contin-
ues today as the disguised basis of evolutionary biology.
For example, evolutionists still teach that giraffes kept
20 The Evolution Cruncher
stretching their necks to reach higher branches, so their
necks became longer! In a later book, *
Darwin abandoned
natural selection as unworkable, and returned to
Lamarckism as the cause of the never-observed
change from one species to another
(*Randall Hedtke,
The Secret of the Sixth Edition, 1984).

2 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY EVOLUTIONISTS
And now we will view the armchair philosophers.
Hardly one of them ever set foot in field research or en-
tered the door of a science laboratory, yet they founded
the modern theory of evolution:
*
Emmanuel Swedenborg
(1688-1772) was a do-noth-
ing expert. In his 1734 book,
Principia,
he theorized that a
rapidly rotating nebula formed itself into our solar system
of sun and planets.
He claimed that he obtained the idea
from spirits during a séance. It is significant that the
nebular hypothesis theory originated from such a
source.
*
Comte de Buffon
(1707-1788) was a dissolute phi-
22 The Evolution Cruncher
losopher who, unable to improve on the work of Linnaeus,
spent his time criticizing him.
He theorized that species
originated from one another and that a chunk was
torn out of the sun, which became our planet.
As with
the other philosophers, he presented no evidence in sup-
port of his theories.
*
Jean-Baptist Lamarck
(1744-1829) made a name
for himself by theorizing. He accomplished little else of
significance.
He laid the foundation of modern evolu-
tionary theory, with his concept of “inheritance of ac-
quired characteristics,” which was later given the
name
Lamarckism
.
In 1809, he published a book,
Philosophie
zoologique
, in which he declared that the giraffe got its
long neck by stretching it up to reach the higher branches,
and birds that lived in water grew webbed feet. According
to that, if you pull hard on your feet, you will gradually
increase their length; and, if you decide in your mind to do
so, you can grow hair on your bald head, and your off-
spring will never be bald. This is science?
*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.
*
Robert Chambers
(1802-1883)
was a spiritualist
who regularly communicated with spirits. As a result
of his contacts, he wrote the first popular evolution book
in all of Britain. Called
Vestiges of Creation
(1844), it was
printed 15 years before *Charles Darwin’s book,
Origin
of the Species
.
*
Charles Lyell
(1797-1875). Like *Charles Darwin,
Lyell inherited great wealth and was able to spend his time
theorizing. Lyell published his
Principles of Geology
in
1830-1833, and
it became the basis for the modern
theory of sedimentary strata,—even though 20th-cen-
tury discoveries in radiodating, radiocarbon dating,
missing strata, and overthrusts (older strata on top of
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 23
more recent strata) have nullified the theory.
In order to prove his theory,
Lyell was quite willing
to misstate the facts.
He learned that Niagara Falls had
eroded a seven-mile [11 km] channel from Queenston,
Ontario, and that it was eroding at about 3 feet [1 m] a
year. So Lyell conveniently changed that to one foot [.3
m] a year, which meant that the falls had been flowing for
35,000 years! But Lyell had not told the truth. Three-foot
erosion a year, at its present rate of flow, would only take
us back 7000 to 9000 years,—and it would be expected
that, just after the Flood, the flow would, for a time, have
greatly increased the erosion rate.
Lyell was a close friend
of Darwin, and urged him to write his book
,
Origin of
the Species.
*
Alfred Russell Wallace
(1823-1913) is considered
to be
the man who developed the theory
which *Darwin
published.
*Wallace was deeply involved in spiritism at
the time he formulated the theory
in his
Ternate Paper
,
which *Darwin, with the help of two friends (*Charles
Lyell and *Joseph Hooker), pirated and published under
his own name. *Darwin, a wealthy man, thus obtained the
royalties which belonged to Wallace, a poverty-ridden
theorist. In 1980, *Arnold C. Brackman, in his book,
A
Delicate Arrangement
, established that Darwin plagiarized
Wallace’s material. It was arranged that a paper by Dar-
win would be read to the Royal Society, in London, while
Wallace’s was held back until later. Priorities for the ideas
thus having been taken care of, Darwin set to work to pre-
pare his book.
In 1875,
Wallace came out openly for spiritism and
Marxism, another stepchild of Darwinism.
This was
Wallace’s theory: Species have changed in the past, by
which one species descended from another in a manner
that we cannot prove today. That is exactly what modern
evolution teaches. Yet it has no more evidence supporting
the theory than Wallace had in 1858 when he devised the
theory while in a fever.
In February 1858, while in a delirious fever on the
24 The Evolution Cruncher
island of Ternate in the Molaccas,
Wallace conceived
the idea,
“survival of the fittest,”
as being the method
by which species change. But the concept proves
nothing.
The fittest; which one is that?
It is the one that
survived longest.
Which one survives longest? The fit-
test.
This is reasoning in a circle.
The phrase says noth-
ing about the evolutionary process, much less proving it.
In the first edition of his book, Darwin regarded “natu-
ral selection” and “survival of the fittest” as different con-
cepts. By the sixth edition of his
Origin of the Species,
he
thought they meant the same thing, but that “survival of
the fittest” was the more accurate. In a still later book
(De-
scent of Man, 1871)
,
Darwin ultimately abandoned
“natural selection” as a hopeless mechanism and re-
turned to Lamarckism. Even Darwin recognized the
theory was falling to pieces.
The supporting evidence just
was not there.
*
Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) was born into wealth
and able to have a life of ease. He took two years of medi-
cal school at Edinburgh University, and then dropped out.
It was the only scientific training he ever received. Be-
cause he spent the time in bars with his friends, he barely
passed his courses. Darwin had no particular purpose in
life, and his father planned to get him into a nicely paid job
as an Anglican minister. Darwin did not object.
But an influential relative got him a position as
the unpaid “naturalist” on a ship planning to sail
around the world, the
Beagle.
The voyage lasted from
December 1831 to October 1836. Chapter 1 ———

rists, Mendel was a true scientist. He bred garden peas and
studied the results of crossing various varieties. Begin-
ning his work in 1856, he concluded it within eight years.
In 1865, he reported his research in the
Journal of the Brunn
Society for the Study of Natural Science
. The journal was
distributed to 120 libraries in Europe, England, and
America. Yet his research was totally ignored by the sci-
entific community until it was rediscovered in 1900
(*R.A.
Fisher, “Has Mendel’s Work Been Rediscovered?” An-
nals of Science, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1936).
His experiments
clearly showed that one species could not transmute
into another one. A genetic barrier existed that could
not be bridged. Mendel’s work laid the basis for mod-
ern genetics, and his discoveries effectively destroyed

the basis for species evolution
(*Michael Pitman,
Adam and Evolution, 1984, pp. 63-64)
.
Louis Pasteur
(1822-1895) was another genuine sci-
entist. In the process of studying fermentation, he per-
formed his famous 1861 experiment, in which
he dis-
proved the theory of spontaneous generation. Life can-
not arise from non-living materials.
This experiment was
very important; for, up to that time, a majority of scien-
tists believed in spontaneous generation. (They thought
that if a pile of old clothes were left in a corner, it would
breed mice! The proof was that, upon later returning to the
clothes, mice would frequently be found there.)
Pasteur
concluded from his experiment that only God could
create living creatures. But modern evolutionary theory
continues to be based on that out-dated theory dis-
proved by Pasteur: spontaneous generation (life
arises from non-life). Why? Because it is the only
basis on which evolution could occur.
As *Adams notes,
“With spontaneous generation discredited [by Pasteur], bi-
ologists were left with no theory of the origin of life at all”
(*J. Edison Adams, Plants: An Introduction to Modern
Biology, 1967, p. 585).
August Friedrich Leopold Weismann
(1834-1914)
was a German biologist who
disproved *Lamarck’s no-
tion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics.”
He is primarily remembered as the scientist who cut off
the tails of 901 young white mice in 19 successive genera-
tions, yet each new generation was born with a full-length
tail. The final generation, he reported, had tails as long as
those originally measured on the first. Weismann also car-
ried out other experiments that buttressed his refutation of
Lamarckism. His discoveries, along with the fact that cir-
cumcision of Jewish males for 4,000 years had not affected
the foreskin, doomed the theory
(*Jean Rostand, Orion
Book of Evolution, 1960, p. 64).
Yet Lamarckism contin-
ues today as the disguised basis of evolutionary biology.
For example, evolutionists still teach that giraffes kept
20 The Evolution Cruncher
stretching their necks to reach higher branches, so their
necks became longer! In a later book, *
Darwin abandoned
natural selection as unworkable, and returned to
Lamarckism as the cause of the never-observed
change from one species to another
(*Randall Hedtke,

2 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY EVOLUTIONISTS
And now we will view the armchair philosophers.
Hardly one of them ever set foot in field research or en-
tered the door of a science laboratory, yet they founded
the modern theory of evolution:
*
Emmanuel Swedenborg
(1688-1772) was a do-noth-
ing expert. In his 1734 book,
Principia,
he theorized that a
rapidly rotating nebula formed itself into our solar system
of sun and planets.
He claimed that he obtained the idea
from spirits during a séance. It is significant that the
nebular hypothesis theory originated from such a
source.
*
Comte de Buffon
(1707-1788) was a dissolute phi-
22 The Evolution Cruncher
losopher who, unable to improve on the work of Linnaeus,
spent his time criticizing him.
He theorized that species
originated from one another and that a chunk was
torn out of the sun, which became our planet.
As with
the other philosophers, he presented no evidence in sup-
port of his theories.
*
Jean-Baptist Lamarck
(1744-1829) made a name
for himself by theorizing. He accomplished little else of
significance.
He laid the foundation of modern evolu-
tionary theory, with his concept of “inheritance of ac-
quired characteristics,” which was later given the
name
Lamarckism
.
In 1809, he published a book,
Philosophie
zoologique
, in which he declared that the giraffe got its
long neck by stretching it up to reach the higher branches,
and birds that lived in water grew webbed feet. According
to that, if you pull hard on your feet, you will gradually
increase their length; and, if you decide in your mind to do
so, you can grow hair on your bald head, and your off-
spring will never be bald. This is science?
*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.
*
Robert Chambers
(1802-1883)
was a spiritualist
who regularly communicated with spirits. As a result
of his contacts, he wrote the first popular evolution book
in all of Britain. Called
Vestiges of Creation
(1844), it was
printed 15 years before *Charles Darwin’s book,
Origin
of the Species
.
*
Charles Lyell
(1797-1875). Like *Charles Darwin,
Lyell inherited great wealth and was able to spend his time
theorizing. Lyell published his
Principles of Geology
in
1830-1833, and
it became the basis for the modern
theory of sedimentary strata,—even though 20th-cen-
tury discoveries in radiodating, radiocarbon dating,
missing strata, and overthrusts (older strata on top of
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 23
more recent strata) have nullified the theory.
In order to prove his theory,
Lyell was quite willing
to misstate the facts.
He learned that Niagara Falls had
eroded a seven-mile [11 km] channel from Queenston,
Ontario, and that it was eroding at about 3 feet [1 m] a
year. So Lyell conveniently changed that to one foot [.3
m] a year, which meant that the falls had been flowing for
35,000 years! But Lyell had not told the truth. Three-foot
erosion a year, at its present rate of flow, would only take
us back 7000 to 9000 years,—and it would be expected
that, just after the Flood, the flow would, for a time, have
greatly increased the erosion rate.
Lyell was a close friend
of Darwin, and urged him to write his book
,
Origin of
the Species.
*
Alfred Russell Wallace
(1823-1913) is considered
to be
the man who developed the theory
which *Darwin
published.
*Wallace was deeply involved in spiritism at
the time he formulated the theory
in his
Ternate Paper
,
which *Darwin, with the help of two friends (*Charles
Lyell and *Joseph Hooker), pirated and published under
his own name. *Darwin, a wealthy man, thus obtained the
royalties which belonged to Wallace, a poverty-ridden
theorist. In 1980, *Arnold C. Brackman, in his book,
A
Delicate Arrangement
, established that Darwin plagiarized
Wallace’s material. It was arranged that a paper by Dar-
win would be read to the Royal Society, in London, while
Wallace’s was held back until later. Priorities for the ideas
thus having been taken care of, Darwin set to work to pre-
pare his book.
In 1875,
Wallace came out openly for spiritism and
Marxism, another stepchild of Darwinism.
This was
Wallace’s theory: Species have changed in the past, by
which one species descended from another in a manner
that we cannot prove today. That is exactly what modern
evolution teaches. Yet it has no more evidence supporting
the theory than Wallace had in 1858 when he devised the
theory while in a fever.
In February 1858, while in a delirious fever on the
24 The Evolution Cruncher
island of Ternate in the Molaccas,
Wallace conceived
the idea,
“survival of the fittest,”
as being the method
by which species change. But the concept proves
nothing.
The fittest; which one is that?
It is the one that
survived longest.
Which one survives longest? The fit-
test.
This is reasoning in a circle.
The phrase says noth-
ing about the evolutionary process, much less proving it.
In the first edition of his book, Darwin regarded “natu-
ral selection” and “survival of the fittest” as different con-
cepts. By the sixth edition of his
Origin of the Species,
he
thought they meant the same thing, but that “survival of
the fittest” was the more accurate. In a still later book
(De-
scent of Man, 1871)
,
Darwin ultimately abandoned
“natural selection” as a hopeless mechanism and re-
turned to Lamarckism. Even Darwin recognized the
theory was falling to pieces.
The supporting evidence just
was not there.
*
Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) was born into wealth
and able to have a life of ease. He took two years of medi-
cal school at Edinburgh University, and then dropped out.
It was the only scientific training he ever received. Be-
cause he spent the time in bars with his friends, he barely
passed his courses. Darwin had no particular purpose in
life, and his father planned to get him into a nicely paid job
as an Anglican minister. Darwin did not object.
But an influential relative got him a position as
the unpaid “naturalist” on a ship planning to sail
around the world, the
Beagle.
The voyage lasted from
December 1831 to October 1836. Chapter 1 ———

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
:
Stellar evolution
is based on the con-
cept that nothing can explode and produce all the stars and
worlds.
Life evolution
is founded on the twin theories of
spontaneous generation
and
Lamarckism
(the inheritance
of acquired characteristics);—yet, although they remain
the basis of biological evolution, both were debunked by
scientists over a century ago.
Science is the study of the natural world. We are
thankful for the many dedicated scientists who are hard
at work, improving life for us.
But we will learn, in this
book, that their discoveries have provided no worthwhile
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 15
evidence supporting evolutionary theory.
Premises
are important. These are the concepts by
which scientific facts are interpreted.
For over a century,
efforts have been made to explain scientific discoveries
by a mid-19th century theory, known as “evolution.”
It has formed the foundation for many other theo-
ries, which also are not founded on scientific facts!
Restating them again,
here are the two premises on
which the various theories of evolution are based:
1 - This is the evolutionary formula for making a
universe:
Nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural
elements + time = all physical laws and a completely
structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets,
and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order.
2 - This is the evolutionary formula for making life:
Dirt + water + time = living creatures.
Evolutionists theorize that the above two formulas
can enable everything about us to make itself—with
the exception of man-made things,
such as automobiles
or buildings. Complicated things, such as wooden boxes
with nails in them, require thought, intelligence, and care-
ful workmanship. But everything else about us in nature
(such as hummingbirds and the human eye) is declared to
be the result of accidental mishaps, random confusion, and
time. You will not even need raw materials to begin with.
They make themselves too.
How did all this nonsense get started?
We will begin
this paperback with a brief overview of the modern his-
tory of evolutionary theory.
But let us not forget that, though it may be nonsensi-
cal,
evolutionary theory has greatly affected—and dam-
aged—mankind in the 20th century.
Will we continue
to let this happen, now that we are in the 21st century?
The social and moral impact that evolutionary concepts
have had on the modern world has been terrific.
16 The Evolution Cruncher
Morality and ethical standards
have been greatly
reduced. Children and youth are taught in school that they
are
an advanced level of animals
; there are
no moral
principles
. Since they are just animals, they should
do
whatever they want
. Personal survival and success will
come only by
rivalry, strife
, and stepping on others.
Here is a brief overview of some of the people and
events in the history of modern evolutionary theory. But it
is only a glimpse.
Much more will be found as you read
farther in this paperback.
And it is all fascinating read-
ing!
Only a few items are listed in this chapter, but they are
enough to provide you with a nice entry point to the rest of
this paperback. Keep in mind that you can look in the In-
dex, at the back of this paperback, and frequently find still
more information on a given subject (“Linnaeus,” “Ther-
modynamics,” “Guadeloupe Woman,” “Mendel,” etc.).
1 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY SCIENTISTS
Prior to the middle of the 1800s, scientists were re-
searchers
who firmly believed that all nature was made
by a Master Designer.
Those pioneers who laid the foun-
dations of modern science were creationists.
They were
men of giant intellect who struggled against great odds in
carrying on their work. They were hard-working research-
ers.
In contrast, the philosophers sat around, hardly stir-
ring from their armchairs and theorized about everything
while the scientists, ignoring them, kept at their work.
But a change came about in the 19th century, when
the philosophers tried to gain control of scientific en-
deavor
and suppress research and findings that would be
unfavorable to their theories. Today’s evolutionists vigor-
ously defend the unscientific theories they thought up over
a century ago.
William Paley
(1743-1805), in his 1802 classic,
Natu-
ral Theology,
summarized the viewpoint of the scientists.
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 17
He argued that
the kind of carefully designed struc-
tures we see in the living world point clearly to a
Designer.
If we see a watch, we know that it had a de-
signer and maker; it would be foolish to imagine that it
made itself.
This is the “argument by design.”
All about
us is the world of nature, and over our heads at night is a
universe of stars. We can ignore or ridicule what is there
or say it all made itself, but our scoffing does not change
the reality of the situation. A leading atheistic scientist of
our time, *Fred Hoyle, wrote that, although it was not diffi-
cult to disprove Darwinism, what Paley had to say appeared
likely to be unanswerable
(*Fred Hoyle and *Chandra
Wickramasinghe, Evolution from Space, 1981, p. 96).
It is a remarkable fact that the basis of evolution-
ary theory was destroyed by seven scientific research
findings,—before *Charles Darwin first published the
theory.
Carl Linn (Carolus Linnaeus
, 1707-1778) was a sci-
entist who classified immense numbers of living organ-
isms. An earnest creationist, he clearly saw that
there were
no halfway species. All plant and animal species were
definite categories, separate from one another.
Varia-
tion was possible within a species, and there were many
sub-species. But
there were no cross-overs from one spe-
cies to another
(*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution,
1990, p. 276).
First Law of Thermodynamics
(1847). Heinrich von
Helmholtz stated
the
law of conservation of energy
: The
sum total of all matter will always remain the same.
This
law refutes several aspects of evolutionary theory.
*Isaac Asimov calls it “the most fundamental generaliza-
tion about the universe that scientists have ever been able
to make”
(*Isaac Asimov, “In the Game of Energy and
Thermodynamics You Can’t Even Break Even,” Journal
of Smithsonian Institute, June 1970, p. 6).
Second Law of Thermodynamics
(1850). R.J.E.
18 The Evolution Cruncher
Clausius stated
the
law of entropy
:
All systems will tend
toward the most mathematically probable state, and even-
tually become totally random and disorganized
(*Harold
Blum, Time’s Arrow and Evolution, 1968, p. 201).
In other
words,
everything runs down, wears out, and goes to
pieces
(*R.R. Kindsay, “Physics: to What Extent is it De-
terministic,” American Scientist 56, 1968, p. 100).
This
law totally eliminates the basic evolutionary theory that
simple evolves into complex.
*Einstein said the two laws
were the most enduring laws he knew of
(*Jeremy Rifkin,
Entropy: A New World View, 1980, p. 6).
Guadeloupe Woman Found
(1812). This is a well-
authenticated discovery which has been in the British Mu-
seum for over a century. A fully modern human skeleton
was found in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe
inside an immense slab of limestone, dated by modern ge-
ologists at 28 million years old. (More examples could be
cited.)
Human beings, just like those living today (but
sometimes larger), have been found in very deep lev-
els of strata.
Gregor Mendel
(1822-1884) was a creationist who
lived and worked near Brunn (now Brno), Czechoslova-
kia. He was a science and math teacher. Unlike the theo-
rists, Mendel was a true scientist. He bred garden peas and

*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.

Robert Chambers
(1802-1883)
was a spiritualist
who regularly communicated with spirits. As a result
of his contacts, he wrote the first popular evolution book
in all of Britain. Called
Vestiges of Creation
(1844), it was
printed 15 years before *Charles Darwin’s book,
Origin
of the Species
.
*
Charles Lyell
(1797-1875). Like *Charles Darwin,
Lyell inherited great wealth and was able to spend his time
theorizing. Lyell published his
Principles of Geology
in
1830-1833, and
it became the basis for the modern
theory of sedimentary strata,—even though 20th-cen-
tury discoveries in radiodating, radiocarbon dating,
missing strata, and overthrusts (older strata on top of
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 23
more recent strata) have nullified the theory.
In order to prove his theory,
Lyell was quite willing
to misstate the facts.
He learned that Niagara Falls had
eroded a seven-mile [11 km] channel from Queenston,
Ontario, and that it was eroding at about 3 feet [1 m] a
year. So Lyell conveniently changed that to one foot [.3
m] a year, which meant that the falls had been flowing for
35,000 years! But Lyell had not told the truth. Three-foot
erosion a year, at its present rate of flow, would only take
us back 7000 to 9000 years,—and it would be expected
that, just after the Flood, the flow would, for a time, have
greatly increased the erosion rate.
Lyell was a close friend
of Darwin, and urged him to write his book
,
Origin of
the Species.
*
Alfred Russell Wallace
(1823-1913) is considered
to be
the man who developed the theory
which *Darwin
published.
*Wallace was deeply involved in spiritism at
the time he formulated the theory
in his
Ternate Paper
,
which *Darwin, with the help of two friends (*Charles
Lyell and *Joseph Hooker), pirated and published under
his own name. *Darwin, a wealthy man, thus obtained the
royalties which belonged to Wallace, a poverty-ridden
theorist. In 1980, *Arnold C. Brackman, in his book,
A
Delicate Arrangement
, established that Darwin plagiarized
Wallace’s material. It was arranged that a paper by Dar-
win would be read to the Royal Society, in London, while
Wallace’s was held back until later. Priorities for the ideas
thus having been taken care of, Darwin set to work to pre-
pare his book.
In 1875,
Wallace came out openly for spiritism and
Marxism, another stepchild of Darwinism.
This was
Wallace’s theory: Species have changed in the past, by
which one species descended from another in a manner
that we cannot prove today. That is exactly what modern
evolution teaches. Yet it has no more evidence supporting
the theory than Wallace had in 1858 when he devised the
theory while in a fever.
In February 1858, while in a delirious fever on the
24 The Evolution Cruncher
island of Ternate in the Molaccas,
Wallace conceived
the idea,
“survival of the fittest,”
as being the method
by which species change. But the concept proves
nothing.
The fittest; which one is that?
It is the one that
survived longest.
Which one survives longest? The fit-
test.
This is reasoning in a circle.
The phrase says noth-
ing about the evolutionary process, much less proving it.
In the first edition of his book, Darwin regarded “natu-
ral selection” and “survival of the fittest” as different con-
cepts. By the sixth edition of his
Origin of the Species,
he
thought they meant the same thing, but that “survival of
the fittest” was the more accurate. In a still later book
(De-
scent of Man, 1871)
,
Darwin ultimately abandoned
“natural selection” as a hopeless mechanism and re-
turned to Lamarckism. Even Darwin recognized the
theory was falling to pieces.
The supporting evidence just
was not there.
*
Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) was born into wealth
and able to have a life of ease. He took two years of medi-
cal school at Edinburgh University, and then dropped out.
It was the only scientific training he ever received. Be-
cause he spent the time in bars with his friends, he barely
passed his courses. Darwin had no particular purpose in
life, and his father planned to get him into a nicely paid job
as an Anglican minister. Darwin did not object.
But an influential relative got him a position as
the unpaid “naturalist” on a ship planning to sail
around the world, the
Beagle.

Stellar evolution
is based on the con-
cept that nothing can explode and produce all the stars and
worlds.
Life evolution
is founded on the twin theories of
spontaneous generation
and

(the inheritance

Science is the study of the natural world. We are
thankful for the many dedicated scientists who are hard
at work, improving life for us.
But we will learn, in this
book, that their discoveries have provided no worthwhile
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 15
evidence supporting evolutionary theory.
Premises
are important. These are the concepts by
which scientific facts are interpreted.
For over a century,
efforts have been made to explain scientific discoveries
by a mid-19th century theory, known as “evolution.”
It has formed the foundation for many other theo-
ries, which also are not founded on scientific facts!
Restating them again,
here are the two premises on
which the various theories of evolution are based:
1 - This is the evolutionary formula for making a
universe:
Nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural
elements + time = all physical laws and a completely
structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets,
and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order.
2 - This is the evolutionary formula for making life:
Dirt + water + time = living creatures.
Evolutionists theorize that the above two formulas
can enable everything about us to make itself—with
the exception of man-made things,
such as automobiles
or buildings. Complicated things, such as wooden boxes
with nails in them, require thought, intelligence, and care-
ful workmanship. But everything else about us in nature
(such as hummingbirds and the human eye) is declared to
be the result of accidental mishaps, random confusion, and
time. You will not even need raw materials to begin with.
They make themselves too.
How did all this nonsense get started?
We will begin
this paperback with a brief overview of the modern his-
tory of evolutionary theory.
But let us not forget that, though it may be nonsensi-
cal,
evolutionary theory has greatly affected—and dam-
aged—mankind in the 20th century.
Will we continue
to let this happen, now that we are in the 21st century?
The social and moral impact that evolutionary concepts
have had on the modern world has been terrific.
16 The Evolution Cruncher
Morality and ethical standards
have been greatly
reduced. Children and youth are taught in school that they
are
an advanced level of animals
; there are
no moral
principles
. Since they are just animals, they should
do
whatever they want
. Personal survival and success will
come only by
rivalry, strife
, and stepping on others.
Here is a brief overview of some of the people and
events in the history of modern evolutionary theory. But it
is only a glimpse.
Much more will be found as you read
farther in this paperback.
And it is all fascinating read-
ing!
Only a few items are listed in this chapter, but they are
enough to provide you with a nice entry point to the rest of
this paperback. Keep in mind that you can look in the In-
dex, at the back of this paperback, and frequently find still
more information on a given subject (“Linnaeus,” “Ther-
modynamics,” “Guadeloupe Woman,” “Mendel,” etc.).
1 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY SCIENTISTS
Prior to the middle of the 1800s, scientists were re-
searchers
who firmly believed that all nature was made
by a Master Designer.
Those pioneers who laid the foun-
dations of modern science were creationists.
They were
men of giant intellect who struggled against great odds in
carrying on their work. They were hard-working research-
ers.
In contrast, the philosophers sat around, hardly stir-
ring from their armchairs and theorized about everything
while the scientists, ignoring them, kept at their work.
But a change came about in the 19th century, when
the philosophers tried to gain control of scientific en-
deavor
and suppress research and findings that would be
unfavorable to their theories. Today’s evolutionists vigor-
ously defend the unscientific theories they thought up over
a century ago.
William Paley
(1743-1805), in his 1802 classic,
Natu-
ral Theology,
summarized the viewpoint of the scientists.
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 17
He argued that
the kind of carefully designed struc-
tures we see in the living world point clearly to a
Designer.
If we see a watch, we know that it had a de-
signer and maker; it would be foolish to imagine that it
made itself.
This is the “argument by design.”
All about
us is the world of nature, and over our heads at night is a
universe of stars. We can ignore or ridicule what is there
or say it all made itself, but our scoffing does not change
the reality of the situation. A leading atheistic scientist of
our time, *Fred Hoyle, wrote that, although it was not diffi-
cult to disprove Darwinism, what Paley had to say appeared
likely to be unanswerable
(*Fred Hoyle and *Chandra
Wickramasinghe, Evolution from Space, 1981, p. 96).
It is a remarkable fact that the basis of evolution-
ary theory was destroyed by seven scientific research
findings,—before *Charles Darwin first published the
theory.
Carl Linn (Carolus Linnaeus
, 1707-1778) was a sci-
entist who classified immense numbers of living organ-
isms. An earnest creationist, he clearly saw that
there were
no halfway species. All plant and animal species were
definite categories, separate from one another.
Varia-
tion was possible within a species, and there were many
sub-species. But
there were no cross-overs from one spe-
cies to another
(*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution,
1990, p. 276).
First Law of Thermodynamics
(1847). Heinrich von
Helmholtz stated
the
law of conservation of energy
: The
sum total of all matter will always remain the same.
This
law refutes several aspects of evolutionary theory.
*Isaac Asimov calls it “the most fundamental generaliza-
tion about the universe that scientists have ever been able
to make”
(*Isaac Asimov, “In the Game of Energy and
Thermodynamics You Can’t Even Break Even,” Journal
of Smithsonian Institute, June 1970, p. 6).
Second Law of Thermodynamics
(1850). R.J.E.
18 The Evolution Cruncher
Clausius stated
the
law of entropy
:
All systems will tend
toward the most mathematically probable state, and even-
tually become totally random and disorganized
(*Harold
Blum, Time’s Arrow and Evolution, 1968, p. 201).
In other
words,
everything runs down, wears out, and goes to
pieces
(*R.R. Kindsay, “Physics: to What Extent is it De-
terministic,” American Scientist 56, 1968, p. 100).
This
law totally eliminates the basic evolutionary theory that
simple evolves into complex.
*Einstein said the two laws
were the most enduring laws he knew of
(*Jeremy Rifkin,
Entropy: A New World View, 1980, p. 6).
Guadeloupe Woman Found
(1812). This is a well-
authenticated discovery which has been in the British Mu-
seum for over a century. A fully modern human skeleton
was found in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe
inside an immense slab of limestone, dated by modern ge-
ologists at 28 million years old. (More examples could be
cited.)
Human beings, just like those living today (but
sometimes larger), have been found in very deep lev-
els of strata.
Gregor Mendel
(1822-1884) was a creationist who
lived and worked near Brunn (now Brno), Czechoslova-
kia. He was a science and math teacher. Unlike the theo-
rists, Mendel was a true scientist. He bred garden peas and
studied the results of crossing various varieties. Begin-
ning his work in 1856, he concluded it within eight years.
In 1865, he reported his research in the
Journal of the Brunn
Society for the Study of Natural Science
. The journal was
distributed to 120 libraries in Europe, England, and
America. Yet his research was totally ignored by the sci-
entific community until it was rediscovered in 1900
(*R.A.
Fisher, “Has Mendel’s Work Been Rediscovered?” An-
nals of Science, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1936).
His experiments
clearly showed that one species could not transmute
into another one. A genetic barrier existed that could
not be bridged. Mendel’s work laid the basis for mod-
ern genetics, and his discoveries effectively destroyed
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 19
the basis for species evolution
(*Michael Pitman,
Adam and Evolution, 1984, pp. 63-64)
.
Louis Pasteur
(1822-1895) was another genuine sci-
entist. In the process of studying fermentation, he per-
formed his famous 1861 experiment, in which
he dis-
proved the theory of spontaneous generation. Life can-
not arise from non-living materials.
This experiment was
very important; for, up to that time, a majority of scien-
tists believed in spontaneous generation. (They thought
that if a pile of old clothes were left in a corner, it would
breed mice! The proof was that, upon later returning to the
clothes, mice would frequently be found there.)
Pasteur
concluded from his experiment that only God could
create living creatures. But modern evolutionary theory
continues to be based on that out-dated theory dis-
proved by Pasteur: spontaneous generation (life
arises from non-life). Why? Because it is the only
basis on which evolution could occur.
As *Adams notes,
“With spontaneous generation discredited [by Pasteur], bi-
ologists were left with no theory of the origin of life at all”
(*J. Edison Adams, Plants: An Introduction to Modern
Biology, 1967, p. 585).
August Friedrich Leopold Weismann
(1834-1914)
was a German biologist who
disproved *Lamarck’s no-
tion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics.”
He is primarily remembered as the scientist who cut off
the tails of 901 young white mice in 19 successive genera-
tions, yet each new generation was born with a full-length
tail. The final generation, he reported, had tails as long as
those originally measured on the first. Weismann also car-
ried out other experiments that buttressed his refutation of
Lamarckism. His discoveries, along with the fact that cir-
cumcision of Jewish males for 4,000 years had not affected
the foreskin, doomed the theory
(*Jean Rostand, Orion
Book of Evolution, 1960, p. 64).
Yet Lamarckism contin-
ues today as the disguised basis of evolutionary biology.
For example, evolutionists still teach that giraffes kept
20 The Evolution Cruncher
stretching their necks to reach higher branches, so their
necks became longer! In a later book, *
Darwin abandoned
natural selection as unworkable, and returned to
Lamarckism as the cause of the never-observed
change from one species to another
(*Randall Hedtke,
The Secret of the Sixth Edition, 1984).
Here is a brief, partial overview of what true scien-
tists were accomplishing in the 18th and 19th centuries.

2 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY EVOLUTIONISTS
And now we will view the armchair philosophers.
Hardly one of them ever set foot in field research or en-
tered the door of a science laboratory, yet they founded
the modern theory of evolution:
*
Emmanuel Swedenborg
(1688-1772) was a do-noth-
ing expert. In his 1734 book,
Principia,
he theorized that a
rapidly rotating nebula formed itself into our solar system
of sun and planets.
He claimed that he obtained the idea
from spirits during a séance. It is significant that the
nebular hypothesis theory originated from such a
source.
*
Comte de Buffon
(1707-1788) was a dissolute phi-
22 The Evolution Cruncher
losopher who, unable to improve on the work of Linnaeus,
spent his time criticizing him.
He theorized that species
originated from one another and that a chunk was
torn out of the sun, which became our planet.
As with
the other philosophers, he presented no evidence in sup-
port of his theories.
*
Jean-Baptist Lamarck
(1744-1829) made a name
for himself by theorizing. He accomplished little else of
significance.
He laid the foundation of modern evolu-
tionary theory, with his concept of “inheritance of ac-
quired characteristics,” which was later given the
name
Lamarckism
.
In 1809, he published a book,
Philosophie
zoologique
, in which he declared that the giraffe got its
long neck by stretching it up to reach the higher branches,
and birds that lived in water grew webbed feet. According
to that, if you pull hard on your feet, you will gradually
increase their length; and, if you decide in your mind to do
so, you can grow hair on your bald head, and your off-
spring will never be bald. This is science?
*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.

1 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY SCIENTISTS
Prior to the middle of the 1800s, scientists were re-
searchers
who firmly believed that all nature was made
by a Master Designer.
Those pioneers who laid the foun-
dations of modern science were creationists.
They were
men of giant intellect who struggled against great odds in
carrying on their work. They were hard-working research-
ers.
In contrast, the philosophers sat around, hardly stir-
ring from their armchairs and theorized about everything
while the scientists, ignoring them, kept at their work.
But a change came about in the 19th century, when
the philosophers tried to gain control of scientific en-
deavor
and suppress research and findings that would be
unfavorable to their theories. Today’s evolutionists vigor-
ously defend the unscientific theories they thought up over
a century ago.
William Paley
(1743-1805), in his 1802 classic,
Natu-
ral Theology,
summarized the viewpoint of the scientists.
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 17
He argued that
the kind of carefully designed struc-
tures we see in the living world point clearly to a
Designer.
If we see a watch, we know that it had a de-
signer and maker; it would be foolish to imagine that it
made itself.
This is the “argument by design.”
All about
us is the world of nature, and over our heads at night is a
universe of stars. We can ignore or ridicule what is there
or say it all made itself, but our scoffing does not change
the reality of the situation. A leading atheistic scientist of
our time, *Fred Hoyle, wrote that, although it was not diffi-
cult to disprove Darwinism, what Paley had to say appeared
likely to be unanswerable
(*Fred Hoyle and *Chandra
Wickramasinghe, Evolution from Space, 1981, p. 96).
It is a remarkable fact that the basis of evolution-
ary theory was destroyed by seven scientific research
findings,—before *Charles Darwin first published the
theory.
Carl Linn (Carolus Linnaeus
, 1707-1778) was a sci-
entist who classified immense numbers of living organ-
isms. An earnest creationist, he clearly saw that
there were
no halfway species. All plant and animal species were
definite categories, separate from one another.
Varia-
tion was possible within a species, and there were many
sub-species. But
there were no cross-overs from one spe-
cies to another
(*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution,
1990, p. 276).
First Law of Thermodynamics
(1847). Heinrich von
Helmholtz stated
the
law of conservation of energy
: The
sum total of all matter will always remain the same.
This
law refutes several aspects of evolutionary theory.
*Isaac Asimov calls it “the most fundamental generaliza-
tion about the universe that scientists have ever been able
to make”
(*Isaac Asimov, “In the Game of Energy and
Thermodynamics You Can’t Even Break Even,” Journal
of Smithsonian Institute, June 1970, p. 6).
Second Law of Thermodynamics
(1850). R.J.E.
18 The Evolution Cruncher
Clausius stated
the
law of entropy
:
All systems will tend
toward the most mathematically probable state, and even-
tually become totally random and disorganized
(*Harold
Blum, Time’s Arrow and Evolution, 1968, p. 201).
In other
words,
everything runs down, wears out, and goes to
pieces
(*R.R. Kindsay, “Physics: to What Extent is it De-
terministic,” American Scientist 56, 1968, p. 100).
This
law totally eliminates the basic evolutionary theory that
simple evolves into complex.
*Einstein said the two laws
were the most enduring laws he knew of
(*Jeremy Rifkin,
Entropy: A New World View, 1980, p. 6).
Guadeloupe Woman Found
(1812). This is a well-
authenticated discovery which has been in the British Mu-
seum for over a century. A fully modern human skeleton
was found in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe
inside an immense slab of limestone, dated by modern ge-
ologists at 28 million years old. (More examples could be
cited.)
Human beings, just like those living today (but
sometimes larger), have been found in very deep lev-
els of strata.
Gregor Mendel
(1822-1884) was a creationist who
lived and worked near Brunn (now Brno), Czechoslova-
kia. He was a science and math teacher. Unlike the theo-
rists, Mendel was a true scientist. He bred garden peas and
studied the results of crossing various varieties. Begin-
ning his work in 1856, he concluded it within eight years.
In 1865, he reported his research in the
Journal of the Brunn
Society for the Study of Natural Science
. The journal was
distributed to 120 libraries in Europe, England, and
America. Yet his research was totally ignored by the sci-
entific community until it was rediscovered in 1900
(*R.A.
Fisher, “Has Mendel’s Work Been Rediscovered?” An-
nals of Science, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1936).
His experiments
clearly showed that one species could not transmute
into another one. A genetic barrier existed that could
not be bridged. Mendel’s work laid the basis for mod-
ern genetics, and his discoveries effectively destroyed

the basis for species evolution
(*Michael Pitman,
Adam and Evolution, 1984, pp. 63-64)
.
Louis Pasteur
(1822-1895) was another genuine sci-
entist. In the process of studying fermentation, he per-
formed his famous 1861 experiment, in which
he dis-
proved the theory of spontaneous generation. Life can-
not arise from non-living materials.
This experiment was
very important; for, up to that time, a majority of scien-
tists believed in spontaneous generation. (They thought
that if a pile of old clothes were left in a corner, it would
breed mice! The proof was that, upon later returning to the
clothes, mice would frequently be found there.)
Pasteur
concluded from his experiment that only God could
create living creatures. But modern evolutionary theory
continues to be based on that out-dated theory dis-
proved by Pasteur: spontaneous generation (life
arises from non-life). Why? Because it is the only
basis on which evolution could occur.
As *Adams notes,
“With spontaneous generation discredited [by Pasteur], bi-
ologists were left with no theory of the origin of life at all”
(*J. Edison Adams, Plants: An Introduction to Modern
Biology, 1967, p. 585).
August Friedrich Leopold Weismann
(1834-1914)
was a German biologist who
disproved *Lamarck’s no-
tion of “the inheritance of acquired characteristics.”
He is primarily remembered as the scientist who cut off
the tails of 901 young white mice in 19 successive genera-
tions, yet each new generation was born with a full-length
tail. The final generation, he reported, had tails as long as
those originally measured on the first. Weismann also car-
ried out other experiments that buttressed his refutation of
Lamarckism. His discoveries, along with the fact that cir-
cumcision of Jewish males for 4,000 years had not affected
the foreskin, doomed the theory
(*Jean Rostand, Orion
Book of Evolution, 1960, p. 64).
Yet Lamarckism contin-
ues today as the disguised basis of evolutionary biology.
For example, evolutionists still teach that giraffes kept
20 The Evolution Cruncher
stretching their necks to reach higher branches, so their
necks became longer! In a later book, *
Darwin abandoned
natural selection as unworkable, and returned to
Lamarckism as the cause of the never-observed
change from one species to another
(*Randall Hedtke,
The Secret of the Sixth Edition, 1984).

2 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY EVOLUTIONISTS
And now we will view the armchair philosophers.
Hardly one of them ever set foot in field research or en-
tered the door of a science laboratory, yet they founded
the modern theory of evolution:
*
Emmanuel Swedenborg
(1688-1772) was a do-noth-
ing expert. In his 1734 book,
Principia,
he theorized that a
rapidly rotating nebula formed itself into our solar system
of sun and planets.
He claimed that he obtained the idea
from spirits during a séance. It is significant that the
nebular hypothesis theory originated from such a
source.
*
Comte de Buffon
(1707-1788) was a dissolute phi-
22 The Evolution Cruncher
losopher who, unable to improve on the work of Linnaeus,
spent his time criticizing him.
He theorized that species
originated from one another and that a chunk was
torn out of the sun, which became our planet.
As with
the other philosophers, he presented no evidence in sup-
port of his theories.
*
Jean-Baptist Lamarck
(1744-1829) made a name
for himself by theorizing. He accomplished little else of
significance.
He laid the foundation of modern evolu-
tionary theory, with his concept of “inheritance of ac-
quired characteristics,” which was later given the
name
Lamarckism
.
In 1809, he published a book,
Philosophie
zoologique
, in which he declared that the giraffe got its
long neck by stretching it up to reach the higher branches,
and birds that lived in water grew webbed feet. According
to that, if you pull hard on your feet, you will gradually
increase their length; and, if you decide in your mind to do
so, you can grow hair on your bald head, and your off-
spring will never be bald. This is science?
*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.
*
Robert Chambers
(1802-1883)
was a spiritualist
who regularly communicated with spirits. As a result
of his contacts, he wrote the first popular evolution book
in all of Britain. Called
Vestiges of Creation
(1844), it was
printed 15 years before *Charles Darwin’s book,
Origin
of the Species
.
*
Charles Lyell
(1797-1875). Like *Charles Darwin,
Lyell inherited great wealth and was able to spend his time
theorizing. Lyell published his
Principles of Geology
in
1830-1833, and
it became the basis for the modern
theory of sedimentary strata,—even though 20th-cen-
tury discoveries in radiodating, radiocarbon dating,
missing strata, and overthrusts (older strata on top of
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 23
more recent strata) have nullified the theory.
In order to prove his theory,
Lyell was quite willing
to misstate the facts.
He learned that Niagara Falls had
eroded a seven-mile [11 km] channel from Queenston,
Ontario, and that it was eroding at about 3 feet [1 m] a
year. So Lyell conveniently changed that to one foot [.3
m] a year, which meant that the falls had been flowing for
35,000 years! But Lyell had not told the truth. Three-foot
erosion a year, at its present rate of flow, would only take
us back 7000 to 9000 years,—and it would be expected
that, just after the Flood, the flow would, for a time, have
greatly increased the erosion rate.
Lyell was a close friend
of Darwin, and urged him to write his book
,
Origin of
the Species.
*
Alfred Russell Wallace
(1823-1913) is considered
to be
the man who developed the theory
which *Darwin
published.
*Wallace was deeply involved in spiritism at
the time he formulated the theory
in his
Ternate Paper
,
which *Darwin, with the help of two friends (*Charles
Lyell and *Joseph Hooker), pirated and published under
his own name. *Darwin, a wealthy man, thus obtained the
royalties which belonged to Wallace, a poverty-ridden
theorist. In 1980, *Arnold C. Brackman, in his book,
A
Delicate Arrangement
, established that Darwin plagiarized
Wallace’s material. It was arranged that a paper by Dar-
win would be read to the Royal Society, in London, while
Wallace’s was held back until later. Priorities for the ideas
thus having been taken care of, Darwin set to work to pre-
pare his book.
In 1875,
Wallace came out openly for spiritism and
Marxism, another stepchild of Darwinism.
This was
Wallace’s theory: Species have changed in the past, by
which one species descended from another in a manner
that we cannot prove today. That is exactly what modern
evolution teaches. Yet it has no more evidence supporting
the theory than Wallace had in 1858 when he devised the
theory while in a fever.
In February 1858, while in a delirious fever on the
24 The Evolution Cruncher
island of Ternate in the Molaccas,
Wallace conceived
the idea,
“survival of the fittest,”
as being the method
by which species change. But the concept proves
nothing.
The fittest; which one is that?
It is the one that
survived longest.
Which one survives longest? The fit-
test.
This is reasoning in a circle.
The phrase says noth-
ing about the evolutionary process, much less proving it.
In the first edition of his book, Darwin regarded “natu-
ral selection” and “survival of the fittest” as different con-
cepts. By the sixth edition of his
Origin of the Species,
he
thought they meant the same thing, but that “survival of
the fittest” was the more accurate. In a still later book
(De-
scent of Man, 1871)
,
Darwin ultimately abandoned
“natural selection” as a hopeless mechanism and re-
turned to Lamarckism. Even Darwin recognized the
theory was falling to pieces.
The supporting evidence just
was not there.
*
Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) was born into wealth
and able to have a life of ease. He took two years of medi-
cal school at Edinburgh University, and then dropped out.
It was the only scientific training he ever received. Be-
cause he spent the time in bars with his friends, he barely
passed his courses. Darwin had no particular purpose in
life, and his father planned to get him into a nicely paid job
as an Anglican minister. Darwin did not object.
But an influential relative got him a position as
the unpaid “naturalist” on a ship planning to sail
around the world, the
Beagle.
The voyage lasted from
December 1831 to October 1836. Chapter 1 ———

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
:
Stellar evolution
is based on the con-
cept that nothing can explode and produce all the stars and
worlds.
Life evolution
is founded on the twin theories of
spontaneous generation
and
Lamarckism
(the inheritance
of acquired characteristics);—yet, although they remain
the basis of biological evolution, both were debunked by
scientists over a century ago.
Science is the study of the natural world. We are
thankful for the many dedicated scientists who are hard
at work, improving life for us.
But we will learn, in this
book, that their discoveries have provided no worthwhile
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 15
evidence supporting evolutionary theory.
Premises
are important. These are the concepts by
which scientific facts are interpreted.
For over a century,
efforts have been made to explain scientific discoveries
by a mid-19th century theory, known as “evolution.”
It has formed the foundation for many other theo-
ries, which also are not founded on scientific facts!
Restating them again,
here are the two premises on
which the various theories of evolution are based:
1 - This is the evolutionary formula for making a
universe:
Nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural
elements + time = all physical laws and a completely
structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets,
and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order.
2 - This is the evolutionary formula for making life:
Dirt + water + time = living creatures.
Evolutionists theorize that the above two formulas
can enable everything about us to make itself—with
the exception of man-made things,
such as automobiles
or buildings. Complicated things, such as wooden boxes
with nails in them, require thought, intelligence, and care-
ful workmanship. But everything else about us in nature
(such as hummingbirds and the human eye) is declared to
be the result of accidental mishaps, random confusion, and
time. You will not even need raw materials to begin with.
They make themselves too.
How did all this nonsense get started?
We will begin
this paperback with a brief overview of the modern his-
tory of evolutionary theory.
But let us not forget that, though it may be nonsensi-
cal,
evolutionary theory has greatly affected—and dam-
aged—mankind in the 20th century.
Will we continue
to let this happen, now that we are in the 21st century?
The social and moral impact that evolutionary concepts
have had on the modern world has been terrific.
16 The Evolution Cruncher
Morality and ethical standards
have been greatly
reduced. Children and youth are taught in school that they
are
an advanced level of animals
; there are
no moral
principles
. Since they are just animals, they should
do
whatever they want
. Personal survival and success will
come only by
rivalry, strife
, and stepping on others.
Here is a brief overview of some of the people and
events in the history of modern evolutionary theory. But it
is only a glimpse.
Much more will be found as you read
farther in this paperback.

ing!

2 - 18th AND 19th CENTURY EVOLUTIONISTS
And now we will view the armchair philosophers.
Hardly one of them ever set foot in field research or en-
tered the door of a science laboratory, yet they founded
the modern theory of evolution:
*
Emmanuel Swedenborg
(1688-1772) was a do-noth-
ing expert. In his 1734 book,
Principia,
he theorized that a
rapidly rotating nebula formed itself into our solar system
of sun and planets.
He claimed that he obtained the idea
from spirits during a séance. It is significant that the
nebular hypothesis theory originated from such a
source.
*
Comte de Buffon
(1707-1788) was a dissolute phi-
22 The Evolution Cruncher
losopher who, unable to improve on the work of Linnaeus,
spent his time criticizing him.
He theorized that species
originated from one another and that a chunk was
torn out of the sun, which became our planet.
As with
the other philosophers, he presented no evidence in sup-
port of his theories.
*
Jean-Baptist Lamarck
(1744-1829) made a name
for himself by theorizing. He accomplished little else of
significance.
He laid the foundation of modern evolu-
tionary theory, with his concept of “inheritance of ac-
quired characteristics,” which was later given the
name
Lamarckism
.
In 1809, he published a book,
Philosophie
zoologique
, in which he declared that the giraffe got its
long neck by stretching it up to reach the higher branches,
and birds that lived in water grew webbed feet. According
to that, if you pull hard on your feet, you will gradually
increase their length; and, if you decide in your mind to do
so, you can grow hair on your bald head, and your off-
spring will never be bald. This is science?
*Lamarck’s other erroneous contribution to evo-
lution was the theory of
uniformitarianism
. This is the
conjecture that all earlier ages on earth were exactly
as they are today, calm and peaceful
with no worldwide
Flood or other great catastrophes.
*
Robert Chambers
(1802-1883)
was a spiritualist
who regularly communicated with spirits. As a result
of his contacts, he wrote the first popular evolution book
in all of Britain. Called
Vestiges of Creation
(1844), it was
printed 15 years before *Charles Darwin’s book,
Origin
of the Species
.
*
Charles Lyell
(1797-1875). Like *Charles Darwin,
Lyell inherited great wealth and was able to spend his time
theorizing. Lyell published his
Principles of Geology
in
1830-1833, and
it became the basis for the modern
theory of sedimentary strata,—even though 20th-cen-
tury discoveries in radiodating, radiocarbon dating,
missing strata, and overthrusts (older strata on top of
Brief History of Evolutionary Theory 23
more recent strata) have nullified the theory.
In order to prove his theory,
Lyell was quite willing
to misstate the facts.
He learned that Niagara Falls had
eroded a seven-mile [11 km] channel from Queenston,
Ontario, and that it was eroding at about 3 feet [1 m] a
year. So Lyell conveniently changed that to one foot [.3
m] a year, which meant that the falls had been flowing for
35,000 years! But Lyell had not told the truth. Three-foot
erosion a year, at its present rate of flow, would only take
us back 7000 to 9000 years,—and it would be expected
that, just after the Flood, the flow would, for a time, have
greatly increased the erosion rate.
Lyell was a close friend
of Darwin, and urged him to write his book
,
Origin of
the Species.
*
Alfred Russell Wallace
(1823-1913) is considered
to be
the man who developed the theory
which *Darwin
published.
*Wallace was deeply involved in spiritism at
the time he formulated the theory
in his
Ternate Paper
,
which *Darwin, with the help of two friends (*Charles
Lyell and *Joseph Hooker), pirated and published under
his own name. *Darwin, a wealthy man, thus obtained the
royalties which belonged to Wallace, a poverty-ridden
theorist. In 1980, *Arnold C. Brackman, in his book,
A
Delicate Arrangement
, established that Darwin plagiarized
Wallace’s material. It was arranged that a paper by Dar-
win would be read to the Royal Society, in London, while
Wallace’s was held back until later. Priorities for the ideas
thus having been taken care of, Darwin set to work to pre-
pare his book.
In 1875,
Wallace came out openly for spiritism and
Marxism, another stepchild of Darwinism.
This was
Wallace’s theory: Species have changed in the past, by
which one species descended from another in a manner
that we cannot prove today. That is exactly what modern
evolution teaches. Yet it has no more evidence supporting
the theory than Wallace had in 1858 when he devised the
theory while in a fever.
In February 1858, while in a delirious fever on the
24 The Evolution Cruncher
island of Ternate in the Molaccas,
Wallace conceived
the idea,
“survival of the fittest,”
as being the method
by which species change. But the concept proves
nothing.
The fittest; which one is that?
It is the one that
survived longest.
Which one survives longest? The fit-
test.
This is reasoning in a circle.
The phrase says noth-
ing about the evolutionary process, much less proving it.
In the first edition of his book, Darwin regarded “natu-
ral selection” and “survival of the fittest” as different con-
cepts. By the sixth edition of his
Origin of the Species,
he
thought they meant the same thing, but that “survival of
the fittest” was the more accurate. In a still later book
(De-
scent of Man, 1871)
,
Darwin ultimately abandoned
“natural selection” as a hopeless mechanism and re-
turned to Lamarckism. Even Darwin recognized the
theory was falling to pieces.
The supporting evidence just
was not there.
*
Charles Darwin
(1809-1882) was born into wealth
and able to have a life of ease. He took two years of medi-
cal school at Edinburgh University, and then dropped out.
It was the only scientific training he ever received. Be-
cause he spent the time in bars with his friends, he barely
passed his courses. Darwin had no particular purpose in
life, and his father planned to get him into a nicely paid job
as an Anglican minister. Darwin did not object.
But an influential relative got him a position as
the unpaid “naturalist” on a ship planning to sail
around the world, the
Beagle.
The voyage lasted from
December 1831 to October 1836.
